```{r notes, include=FALSE, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE}

# The code commented below converts Rmd to R
# - "purl = FALSE" means this particular chunk will not be included in the R output
# - "documentation = 2" argument yields the R markdown TEXT will be included in 
#   the R output as files

# knitr::purl(input = paste0(here::here(), "/func_reg/foo/code_example.Rmd"),
#             output = paste0(here::here(), "/func_reg/foo/code_example.R"),
#             documentation = 2,
#             quiet = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
