## Welcome to class!

1. Introductions
2. Class overview
3. Getting R up and running

## Checking that latex works

Inline $x^2 + 2x + 1$

Centered $$x^2 + 2x + 1$$

Aligned 

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= (x + 1)^2 \\
 & = x^2 + 2x + 1
\end{aligned}
$$

More fancy $$Y=\beta_{0}+\left\langle X^{c}, \beta\right\rangle+\varepsilon=\beta_{0}+\int_{\mathcal{T}} X^{c}(t) \beta(t) d t+\varepsilon$$

## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- R is the open source implementation of the S language, which was developed by Bell laboratories

- R is both open source and open development

(source: http://www.r-project.org/)

## Why R?

* Powerful and flexible

* Free (open source)

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Designed for statistical computing

* High level language

## Why not R?

* Fairly steep learning curve

    * "Programming" oriented
    
    * Minimal interface
    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Java, Perl, Python)


## Introductions

What do you hope to get out of the class?

Why else to use R?

## Installing R

* Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )

* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Collection of R packages

We have an R package called jhur that will make sure all the packages are installed.

You can just copy and paste the below code into your console - we'll explain what it all means in the next day or two

```{r, packageInstall, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/jhur")
```

Note it may take ~5-10 minutes to run.
